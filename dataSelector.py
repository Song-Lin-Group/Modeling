This script is designed to assist with categorization of molecular performance properties by taking
an input Excel workbook "Descriptor Data.xlsx", applying a selection rule to the notebook, and then
writing it to a new Excel workbook "Filtered Descriptor Data.xlsx" with the rule applied.

# apply selection rule.
